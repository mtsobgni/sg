Briefly explain what the performance characteristics are in terms of speed and memory :

Performance in terms of speed :

- To determinate the max of an array the function max do always n-1 comparison . In the worst case the number of assignment is n-1, In the best case the number of assignment is 1
The speed of function max according to the number of operations is in the best case "N" and in the worst case 2N-2. So the complexity of algorith is O(n).

Performance in terms of memory :

For this example the amount of space needed is clearly dominated by the memory consumed by the array, so we don't have to worry about it.
That is take constant extra space. The space complexity is O(n).

Point out any potential problems with the code and suggest how you would solve them :

-a potential problem with this algorithm can occurs when the size of array is important ( size great than 1 billion) or the array is null.

-a other problem will be a OutBoudException while occur when using a for loop. To deal with it we can use a for each loop java.


Propose any alternate ways you could implement this (without using a for loop for example).
